# Popular Data Structure and Algorithms.

This repo contains a collections of ***Algorithms*** and ***Data Structures*** questions which are usually asked for FAANG interviews. 

The implementaiton is done using Java. This repo contains the solutions for the most common Interview and Data structure questions which are asked in interviews. Most of the solutions have test cases which checks their validity. The Time and Space complexity for each solution is also mentioned.

I have created this repo to learn about Data Structures. I hope this repo will help others who are trying to learn DS.

## Problems

### [Arrays](https://github.com/VinnieM/Popular-DS-Questions/blob/main/src/main/java/code/datastructures/Array.java)

1. Reverse an array without using extra space.
2. Get the minimum and maximum element in an array.
3. Get the nth smallest element in an array in O(n) time.
4. Sort an array which contains only 0, 1 and 2 in O(n) time and O(1) space.
5. Move negative elements to the left of the array in O(n) time.
6. Get the Union of 2 arrays.
7. Rotate and array N number of times in O(n) time.
8. Find the largest subarray in O(n) time.
9. Find all duplicate numbers in an array.
10. Find the duplicate number in an array of N + 1 integers ( Solution for O(n) and O(nlogn) )
11. Merge 2 sorted arrays without using extra space.
12. Kadanes Algorithm.
13. Move all the zero's to the left in O(n) time and and O(1) space.
