# Popular Data Structure and Algorithms.

This repo contains a collection of common ***Algorithms*** and ***Data Structures*** questions. 
The implementation is in Java. The questions mentioned below, or a variation of the questions are common for coding interviews. Most of the solutions have test cases which checks their validity. The time and space complexity for each solution is also mentioned.

## Problems

### Arrays
Easy
1. [Reverse an array without using extra space.](https://github.com/VinnieM/Popular-DS-Questions/blob/main/src/main/java/code/datastructures/arrays/ReverseArray.java)
2. [Get the minimum and maximum element in an array.](https://github.com/VinnieM/Popular-DS-Questions/blob/main/src/main/java/code/datastructures/arrays/MaxMinElement.java)
3. [Find the Max and Second Max element in an array.](https://github.com/VinnieM/Popular-DS-Questions/blob/main/src/main/java/code/datastructures/arrays/MaxAndSecondMax.java)
4. [Move negative elements to the left of the array.](https://github.com/VinnieM/Popular-DS-Questions/blob/main/src/main/java/code/datastructures/arrays/NegativeElements.java)
5. [Rotate and array N number of times in O(n) time.](https://github.com/VinnieM/Popular-DS-Questions/blob/main/src/main/java/code/datastructures/arrays/RotateArray.java)
Medium

6. [Get the nth smallest element in an array in O(n) time.](https://github.com/VinnieM/Popular-DS-Questions/blob/main/src/main/java/code/datastructures/arrays/NthSmallestElement.java)
7. [Sort an array which contains only 0, 1 and 2 in O(n) time and O(1) space.](https://github.com/VinnieM/Popular-DS-Questions/blob/main/src/main/java/code/datastructures/arrays/SortCustomArray.java)
8. [Merge 2 sorted arrays.](https://github.com/VinnieM/Popular-DS-Questions/blob/main/src/main/java/code/datastructures/arrays/ArrayUnion.java)
9. [Find the largest sub array in O(n) time.](https://github.com/VinnieM/Popular-DS-Questions/blob/main/src/main/java/code/datastructures/arrays/LargestSum.java)
10. [Find all duplicate numbers in an array.](https://github.com/VinnieM/Popular-DS-Questions/blob/main/src/main/java/code/datastructures/arrays/DuplicateNumber.java)
11. Find the duplicate number in an array of N + 1 integers ( Solution for O(n) and O(nlogn) )
12. Merge 2 sorted arrays without using extra space.
13. Kadanes Algorithm.
14. Move all the zero's to the left in O(n) time and and O(1) space.
15. New Year Chaos - It is New Year's Day and people are in line for the Wonderland rollercoaster ride. Each person wears a sticker indicating their initial position in the queue. Initial positions increment by from at the front of the line to at the back. Any person in the queue can bribe the person directly in front of them to swap positions. If two people swap positions, they still wear the same sticker denoting their original places in line. Fascinated by this chaotic queue, you decide you must know the minimum number of bribes that took place to get the queue into its current state. If anyone has bribed more than two people, the line is too chaotic to compute the answer.
16. Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

### Recursion
Easy
1. [Find the factorial of a number.](https://github.com/VinnieM/Popular-DS-Questions/blob/main/src/main/java/code/datastructures/recursion/FindFactorial.java)
2. [Find the sum of the digits of a given number.](https://github.com/VinnieM/Popular-DS-Questions/blob/main/src/main/java/code/datastructures/recursion/FindSumOfDigits.java)
3. [Reverse a string.](https://github.com/VinnieM/Popular-DS-Questions/blob/main/src/main/java/code/datastructures/recursion/ReverseString.java)
4. [Check if a string is a palindrome.](https://github.com/VinnieM/Popular-DS-Questions/blob/main/src/main/java/code/datastructures/recursion/Palindrome.java)
5. [Find the subsequence of two strings](https://github.com/VinnieM/Popular-DS-Questions/blob/main/src/main/java/code/datastructures/recursion/CheckSubsequence.java)
Medium/Enumeration

6. [Find all unique permutations in an array](https://github.com/VinnieM/Popular-DS-Questions/blob/main/src/main/java/code/datastructures/recursion/Permutations.java)
