# Popular Data Structure and Algorithms.

This repo contains a collections of ***Algorithms*** and ***Data Structures*** questions which are usually asked for FAANG interviews. 

The implementaiton is done using Java. This repo contains the solutions for the most common Interview and Data structure questions which are asked in interviews. Most of the solutions have test cases which checks their validity. The Time and Space complexity for each solution is also mentioned.

I have created this repo to learn about Data Structures. I hope this repo will help others who are trying to learn DS.
